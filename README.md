Have a sneak peak of the visual techniques used (Visual analysis of IRIS dataset)[here](https://github.com/mohd-muzamil/IrisDashboard.git) [Demo](https://explorata.herokuapp.com) and (Implementation using Randomly generated mobile sensing dataset since original dataset is private)[here](https://github.com/mohd-muzamil/flaskDashboard.git)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborate on interesting projects in Machine learning (Audio/Video/Image processing, NLP, Healthcare analytics) or Data visualization using Javascript
